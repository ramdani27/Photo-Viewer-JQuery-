# Photo-Viewer-JQuery-
 I made this just for learn and understanding how to use JQuery to make web aplication more interesting
 and looking dinamic. if you want to test it you need to add the picture or photo and settings the name of your images or photos in index.html file. I'm so proud if you make this better. thank's for looking and download(clone) this web portofolio. Please correct it
